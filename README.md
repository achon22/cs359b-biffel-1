# CS359B Project Biffel

In recent years, the ‘waffling’ subculture has been growing in pockets of the online fashion community. A ‘waffle’ is a type of auction where sellers of an item sell uniformly-priced lots to a range of different bidders. After a certain period of time, a random number determines the winner of the auction. 

Informal waffling is very primitive, as current waffle mediums, like facebook, are unsafe and unreliable. On facebook for example, a post is constantly updated with new slots and buyers, and the final winner is chosen via a scheduled facebook live video of someone going onto random.org and getting a number. This unrefined system is ripe for fraud and manipulation.

With our team - Jaime Deverall (Senior Front End Engineer), Jiwoo Lee (CEO Intern + Backend Distributed Systems Developer) and Miguel Ayala (Solidity Smart Contract Engineer) - biffel is trying to provide a smooth and transparent waffling experience for both buyers and sellers by implementing a provably fair algorithm for pseudo-random number generation.

The dapp is appealing to buyers who want the opportunity to buy items for less than market value, and to sellers who can sell their items for prices above their market value.
